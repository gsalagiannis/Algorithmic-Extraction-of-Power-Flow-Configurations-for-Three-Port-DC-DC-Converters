	abstract = {In this paper, a systematic and analytical study of non-isolated topologies belonging to the family of reduced redundant power processing (R2P2) converters is presented. Based on this study, all the non-isolated R2P2 topologies that can be implemented in reality are derived. Detailed examples clarify all possible cases of this analysis. In addition to this, the voltage ratio and the efficiency for each one of the R2P2 configurations are calculated, being further illustrated with examples. A comparison among configurations is also discussed with criteria the high step-up voltage gain and efficiency, aiming for high-power applications. One of these R2P2 converters is selected for further examination, as the most suitable for such applications. The theoretical analysis, as well as the calculations of the step-up voltage ratio and efficiency of the selected converter, is compared to experimental results conducted on a 2-{kW} laboratory prototype designed to operate in various step-up voltage ratios and in a high-power range, proving the effectiveness of the proposed investigation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a nonisolated high step-up dc/dc converter, belonging to the family of reduced redundant power processing converters (R2P2), is investigated for high-power applications. The selection of this topology as the most suitable for such applications among those belonging to the R2P2 family is justified. Emphasis is given on the theoretical analysis of the real step-up voltage ratio of the converter, and voltage and current stresses under continuous and discontinuous conduction modes of operation, taking into account the nonideality of the topology components, namely the parasitic resistances of semiconductor devices and inductors and the voltage drop of diodes. The theoretical analysis and the behavior of the selected converter are experimentally validated through a 2 {kW} prototype. Moreover, the overall efficiency of the chosen converter is experimentally investigated for various step-up voltage ratios and for a high-power range, considering a waste heat recovery system for a maritime application.},

To maximize the generality of applications, the input ports can possibly be connected with voltage source(s) or current source(s), and the output port can be connected with a voltage load or current load. The control methods are described in this paper. A {DISO} converter with two voltage sources and one voltage load is taken as an example to analyze a few key properties of practical relevance, including input voltage range, efficiency, power distribution, and switching stress. A popular application of {DISO} converters involves the use of a battery as storage element, and for this specific case, possible choices for the converters, the control method, and the attainable efficiency are discussed. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the analytical results.},

	abstract = {The interconnection of basic switching converters to increase power handling capabilities in dc applications has been widely reported in technical literature. This study presents a family of switching step-up dc–dc converters based on the principle of reduced redundant power processing (R2P2). This principle states that the power transfer from input port and output port on interconnected converters is reduced when a non-cascading connection is used. As shown in this study, the principle R2P2 is useful for developing new converters. These have wide conversion ratios and quadratic dependence with respect to the duty ratio. In this study, the voltage conversion ratios, average models and steady-state operating conditions for proposed converters are derived, which are verified by experimental results.},

	abstract = {Multiple-port dc–dc converters are characterized by a variety of kinds and a large number of circuit topologies. In this article, we aim to reveal the intrinsic relationship among the topologies of multiple-port dc–dc converters and propose the topology derivation method. First, the voltage- and current-type ports are summarized from basic dc–dc converters, and the approach of converting current-type ports into voltage-type ports is discussed. Then, according to Kirchhoff's law, four types of multiple-input multiple-output converters named input-port-series output-port-series, input-port-series output-port-parallel, input-port-parallel output-port-series, and input-port-parallel output-port-parallel are presented. Second, the topology derivation method of multiple-port bidirectional dc–dc converters based on the voltage-type ports is studied in terms of power flow paths in various operation modes, and then the topology optimization method is proposed. Particularly, a flow diagram for the optimal design procedure is given to guide the topology derivation for some specific requirements. Based on the proposed approach, a family of multiple-port dc–dc converters can be derived, which provides lots of viable candidates for practical engineering. Furthermore, one derived converter named the parallel-type three-port bidirectional buck converter is analyzed in three operation modes to demonstrate the topology derivation. Finally, the effectiveness of the above theoretical analysis is verified by those experimental results.},

In this overview, we summarize the milestones and general applications of this powerful mathematical tool and illustrate its unique benefits in some emerging/challenging power electronics research topics, for example, systematic converter derivation and modeling, advanced control, and so on. Given the multidiscipline nature of power electronics, graph theory can serve as a bridge for experts in different disciplines with a universal framework for complex problems. With solid mathematical foundations, it can stimulate research of topological aspects in both converter and systematic levels, fits well for nowadays power electronics converter.

Conversely, many fundamental results of algebraic graph theory were laid out by early electrical circuit analysts. In this paper, we survey some fundamental and historic as well as recent results on how algebraic graph theory informs electrical network analysis, dynamics, and design. In particular, we review the algebraic and spectral properties of graph adjacency, Laplacian, incidence, and resistance matrices and how they relate to the analysis, network reduction, and dynamics of certain classes of electrical networks. We study these relations for models of increasing complexity ranging from static resistive direct current (dc) circuits, over dynamic resistor..inductor..capacitor ({RLC}) circuits, to nonlinear alternating current (ac) power flow. We conclude this paper by presenting a set of fundamental open questions at the intersection of algebraic graph theory and electrical networks.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, energy sustainability needs drive the development of novel power system architectures that efficiently harvest and deliver green energy. Specifically, {DC} Microgrids ({DC}-{MG}) have emerged as promising bases for distributed power generation, especially in residential applications. The pivotal role of power conversion and the need for more affordable and compact converters has led to an increasing research interest. {MultiPort} Converters ({MPCs}) exhibit beneficial operational characteristics for these applications and, therefore, a plethora of different topologies is suggested in the literature. Even though there have been some attempts to organize and review the field status, the categorization is based on the existence or not of isolation between the converter’s ports, without providing insight on the topology conception. In this article, a literature review is conducted to specify the most suitable non-isolated {MPC} topologies for residential {DC}-{MGs}. Converters with a power rating ranging from 0.1 to 1 {kW} are compared based on technical features and categorized according to their topology derivation process. This procedure is performed separately for {MPCs} suitable for unipolar and bipolar {DC} Buses. The selected approach highlights the design basis for each {MPC} in a structured manner, facilitating further development of original converters by both new and experienced researchers.},
